 Work for my Intelligent Systems year 3 university project.

Involves Q Learning, in which an intelligent agent learns how to complete dynamic 2D mazes.

The mazes are made dynamic by using Prim's algorithm to randomly generate the maze each time the code is executed. Each time the code is executed, the maze will be different.

Once the maze is created, the agent begins to learn how to complete the maze using the Q Learning reinforcement learning approach.
